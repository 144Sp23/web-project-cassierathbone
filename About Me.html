            <h1>A Little Bit About Me!</h1>
            
            <p> My name is Cassie Rathbone and I am originally from Columbus,NE. I lived in Nebraska up until my freshman year of college where I moved to Missouri. I have always wanted to be a teacher, and love helping out anyone in my community. When I am not with my amazing students, I like to binge shows with my boyfriend, and relax in my home.Fun fact about me... I have never broken a bone! </p>

            <p> For my Bachelor's degree I studied at Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville,MO. Obviously my goal was to become a teacher, but teaching business classes is what I really wanted to do. Not only do I have experience with business and accounting classes, I am also certified in teaching all sorts of computer classes such as digital media as well as basic Microsoft Office resources. </p>
